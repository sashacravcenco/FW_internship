  <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
  <p>Here you have a sample page for one of your awesome application.</p>
  <p>The client wants for the screens that are smaller than IPad the background color of the page to be orange</p>
  <p>And for IPhone X and less to be lightblue</p>
  <p>Use Toggle Device Toolbar for testing and debugging</p>
  <p>Use styles.css file for this exercise</p>
  <p>Use CSS media query for checking device's width</p>
  <p>Example: @media only screen and (max-width: XXXXXpx)</p>
  <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
  <p>Your awesome backend developer has created an API for getting Star Wars People information.</p>
  <p>The problem is that he does not have time to write the documentation.:(</p>
  <p>In index.js file you can find getStarWarsPeople() function with a callback which has res argument where the information about people is stored.</p>
  <p>Use console methods or breakpoints to inspect what is stored inside res argument.</p>
  <p>Show below on this page in p tag with id="info" the number of people found and the first one from the list</p>
  <p>(Do not pay attention to the fetch method. You will learn about Promises and API requests later in the internship)</p>
